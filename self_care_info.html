        <p>All the stress-relief activities in the world won't help if we aren't taking care of ourselves. Self-care has been defined as "a multidimensional, multifaceted process of purposeful engagement in strategies that promote healthy functioning and enhance well-being."1 In simpler terms, self-care is all about caring for yourself—as the name suggests—to ensure your physical and emotional needs are met.</p>

        <p>Self-care is important because it helps re-establish balance and avoid burnout. It is often the mechanism of recalibrating and getting in touch with our ability to play, have fun, relax, and connect.</p>

        <blockquote>

        <p>Good self-care can take on many forms. It could be ensuring we get enough sleep every night or stepping outside for a few minutes for some fresh air. It can also mean taking the time to do what we enjoy.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, you might need more self-care in one specific area to restore balance or find relief from a stressor in your life. To care for your health and well-being, it's important to find a balance that allows you to address each of these areas.</p>

        <h2>At a Glance</h2>
        <p>Self-care is a conscious act people take to promote their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional health. It is vital for building resilience toward life's stressors that we can't eliminate. When you've taken steps to care for your mind and body, you'll be better equipped to live your best life.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, however, many of us view self-care as a luxury rather than a priority. Consequently, we're left feeling overwhelmed, tired, and ill-equipped to handle life's inevitable challenges. It's important to assess how you're caring for yourself in several different domains so you can ensure you're caring for your mind, body, and spirit.</p>
