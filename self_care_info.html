    <p>All the stress-relief activities in the world won't help if we aren't taking care of ourselves. Self-care has been defined as "a multidimensional, multifaceted process of purposeful engagement in strategies that promote healthy functioning and enhance well-being."1 In simpler terms, self-care is all about caring for yourself—as the name suggests—to ensure your physical and emotional needs are met.</p>

    <p>Self-care is important because it helps re-establish balance and avoid burnout. It is often the mechanism of recalibrating and getting in touch with our ability to play, have fun, relax, and connect.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>— SABRINA ROMANOFF, PSYD</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Good self-care can take on many forms. It could be ensuring we get enough sleep every night or stepping outside for a few minutes for some fresh air. It can also mean taking the time to do what we enjoy.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, you might need more self-care in one specific area to restore balance or find relief from a stressor in your life. To care for your health and well-being, it's important to find a balance that allows you to address each of these areas.</p>

    <h2>At a Glance</h2>
    <p>Self-care is a conscious act people take to promote their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional health. It is vital for building resilience toward life's stressors that we can't eliminate. When you've taken steps to care for your mind and body, you'll be better equipped to live your best life.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, however, many of us view self-care as a luxury rather than a priority. Consequently, we're left feeling overwhelmed, tired, and ill-equipped to handle life's inevitable challenges. It's important to assess how you're caring for yourself in several different domains so you can ensure you're caring for your mind, body, and spirit.</p>
        <p>"Caring for your mental health is just as important as caring for your physical health," emphasized Sumayah Abed, M.D., assistant professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at UAB Medicine Hoover Primary and Specialty Care.</p>
        
        <p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, self-care means taking the time to do things that help people live well and improve their physical and mental health.</p>
        
        <p>"Self-care is important because it enhances our well-being by keeping us connected to ourselves and what matters most to us," stated Kaylee Crockett, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist at UAB Department of Family and Community Medicine. "It can help prevent illnesses from occurring or recurring, and it builds our capacity to handle stress and recover from adversity."</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, self-care is sometimes seen as a luxury instead of a necessity, but Crockett emphasizes that it's essential for everyone, not just those who feel stressed.</p>
        
        <p>She recommends making self-care a routine and protecting time for self-care activities. This can involve scheduling self-care time in the calendar or setting standing dates with loved ones. Limiting distractions during self-care activities, such as using the "do not disturb" feature on devices, is also helpful.</p>
        
        <h2>Steps to Prioritize Self-Care</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Eat a balanced diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, seafood, and nuts to improve energy and focus throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Drink at least 60-62 ounces of water daily, and increase intake during the summer. Limit caffeinated and alcoholic beverages.</li>
            <li>Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day, such as walking, to improve mood and health.</li>
            <li>Schedule time each day for relaxing and stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or trying out new hobbies.</li>
            <li>Get seven to nine hours of sleep each night and avoid screens before bedtime to improve sleep quality.</li>
            <li>Build strong relationships with supportive family and friends, and seek out activities to meet new people.</li>
            <li>Seek help from a healthcare provider if self-care efforts are not sufficient or distressing symptoms persist.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>"Self-care looks different for everyone," emphasized Crockett. While discussing preferred self-care activities with others can be insightful, it's crucial to remember what works for them may not work for you. Reflect on activities that bring joy, fulfillment, and meaning, then set small goals to incorporate them into your routine.</p>
            
            <p>Self-care activities should leave you feeling relaxed, energized, and refreshed. If certain activities deplete you, try alternative approaches. Establishing daily self-care habits helps recognize signs of needing more attention during stressful times.</p>
            
            <p>Crockett defines positive mental health as a continuum, where daily distress is minimal, coping strategies are effective, and meaningful activities and relationships are maintained. However, adverse circumstances can lead to greater distress, impacting daily functioning.</p>
            
            <p>Recognizing signs of a mental health crisis is crucial. Abed advises looking out for symptoms like low energy, difficulty concentrating, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, social withdrawal, negative emotions, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, or excessive behaviors.</p>
            
            <p>If managing alone becomes challenging, seeking help is essential. Abed suggests consulting a healthcare provider for symptom interpretation and resource connection. In emergencies, contact 911 or the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 for immediate assistance.</p>
